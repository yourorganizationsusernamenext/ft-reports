Dunno how things work? That's fine. You can learn in five minutes. That's why GitHub is such a wonderful choice. It's extremely simple, clean, and intuitive.

<b>Where are the issues?</b>

Simple basics first. Over to the right, ther's a button that says issues, or is a picture of a circle with an exclamation mark in it. If you're using a mobile device, then this might not be the case. With 5 mobile GitHub apps out there, I can't definitively tell you where the issues button is, so figure it out, but if you're on a computer like a normal person, it's to the right.

<b>What issues do I work on?</b>

Click on labels to add label filters. You should look for things starting from the highest priority, and then work your way down. If you can solve some medium priorities without obstructing the solving of higher priorities, go for it. See what you can contribute to, anything works. You can also sort by things you've been assigned to.

<b>What do I do if I decide to work on something?</b>

There should be, to the right, something that says Assignee. Assign yourself to the issue by clicking on the gear.

<b>How do I add labels to issues?</b>

Click on the gear next to Labels on the same bar that has the Assignee module.

<b>How do I add new labels?</b>

On the issues page, click on labels and add a new one.

<b>How do I close an issue?</b>

There's a button for it at the bottom.
